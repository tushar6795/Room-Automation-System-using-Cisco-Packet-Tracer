Room Automation System Using Cisco
 Packet Tracer
 1. Aim
 To develop a room automation system using Cisco Packet Tracer that enables remote
 monitoring and automatic control of electrical appliances.
 2. Problem Statement
 Manual operation of appliances causes inefficiency. IoT-based automation enables
 smart and intelligent control.
 3. Scope of the Solution
 • Monitoring room conditions using virtual sensors.
 • Automatic control of fan and lamp.
 • Remote accessibility via IoT network infrastructure.
 • Real-time automation workflow simulation.
 4. Required Components
 • Cisco Packet Tracer (IoT-enabled)
 • Home Gateway
 • IoT Server
 • Temperature & Light Sensors
 • Smart Fan & Lamp
 • IoT Microcontroller
 • Networking Connections
 6. Automation Rules
Rule 1: Motion Detector → Light Automation- Motion detected → Light ON- No motion → Light OFF
 Rule 2: Thermostat → Fan Automation- COOL → Fan OFF- HEAT/HOT → Fan ON
 8. Conclusion
 The system demonstrates an IoT-enabled smart room setup using Cisco Packet
 Tracer. It simulates automation, monitoring, and device communication.
